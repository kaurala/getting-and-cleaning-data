## Getting and Cleaning Data_Course Project
## Aurthor : Tong Zhou

### Project Information

The goal of the project is to learn how to get and clean raw data. We have a data of experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19 - 48 years. Subjects are equiped with a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Data Set Information

Here are the data for the project

[experiments data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip )

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
